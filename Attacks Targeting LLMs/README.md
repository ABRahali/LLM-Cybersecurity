# Attacks Targeting Large Language Models (LLMs) and General AI Systems

As AI systems continue to grow in importance, their security becomes increasingly critical. In this README, we will discuss various types of attacks targeting Large Language Models (LLMs) and general AI applications. Additionally, we cover several common attack vectors that pose significant risks to both AI systems and traditional applications.

## Types of Attacks on LLMs

### 1. **Poisoning-Based DoS (P-DoS) Attacks**

   **Description**: Attackers inject malicious input into the training data, overwhelming the system and causing performance issues.
   **Impact**: This can lead to resource exhaustion and model degradation.

### 2. **Sponge Attacks**

   **Description**: These attacks drain system resources by consuming excessive computational power and memory, slowing down or crashing LLMs.
   **Impact**: Resource depletion and potential system crashes.

### 3. **Flowbreaking Attacks**

   **Description**: Attackers hijack AI models to provide harmful or misleading instructions, altering the model's behavior.
   **Impact**: This leads to vulnerabilities and the generation of harmful or incorrect outputs.

### 4. **DDoS Attacks on LLMs**

   **Description**: Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks flood the system with traffic, causing service disruptions and slowdowns.
   **Impact**: Complete system failures and poor user experience.

### 5. **Jailbreaking Attacks**

 **Description** : Jailbreaking refers to exploiting vulnerabilities in AI systems or models to bypass security restrictions, granting unauthorized access to sensitive features or information. In the case of LLMs, attackers may manipulate the model to perform actions outside its intended constraints, such as generating malicious code or accessing protected data.

 **Impact** : Jailbreaking can compromise the integrity of the model, leading to misuse of the AI system, potential data leaks, or generation of harmful outputs. This type of attack often involves circumventing safeguards put in place to control the model's behavior.

### 6. **Prompt Injection Attacks**

 **Description** : Prompt injection attacks involve manipulating the input prompt provided to an LLM in a way that alters the model's output in unexpected or harmful ways. By crafting carefully designed prompts, attackers can trick the model into generating outputs that were never intended, such as sensitive data disclosure or biased content generation.

 **Impact** : This attack can lead to inaccurate outputs, security breaches, and the generation of harmful content. Since LLMs are trained to respond to input patterns, injecting malicious or misleading prompts can bypass safeguards and compromise the model's integrity.
