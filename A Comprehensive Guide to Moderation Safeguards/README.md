# A Comprehensive Guide to Moderation Safeguards

This folder contains a series of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various strategies and practices to safeguard and moderate Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of cybersecurity. These notebooks offer examples to protect LLM systems from vulnerabilities and malicious exploitation, **not real implementations**.

A multi-agent workflow can be created, where different agents take ownership of various components to moderate different aspects of an application. These notebooks aim to serve as starting points and provide a structural reminders.

## Overview

LLMs are powerful tools but come with inherent risks. This collection of notebooks outlines how to delegate responsibility for moderating LLM input, output, data, resources, traffic, access, and topics. It covers specific techniques like prompt injection prevention, adversarial training, and ensuring ethical and regulatory compliance, **at high level only.**

### Included Notebooks:

1. **Input Moderation**Illustrates how a multi-agent system can handle input validation to prevent prompt injections and malicious activity.Notebook: `Input-Moderation.ipynb`
2. **Output Moderation**Demonstrates how different agents can collaborate to prevent hallucinations and harmful content generation.Notebook: `Output_Moderation.ipynb`
3. **Data Moderation**Shows how agents can take ownership of data quality checks, sanitization, and compliance with privacy regulations.Notebook: `Data_Moderation.ipynb`
4. **Resource Moderation**Focuses on how agents manage system stability and computational resources efficiently.Notebook: `Resource_Moderation.ipynb`
5. **Traffic Moderation**Provides a workflow for agents to prevent DoS attacks and maintain balanced system load.Notebook: `Traffic_Moderation.ipynb`
6. **Access Moderation**Demonstrates how agents implement role-based access control and the least privilege principle.Notebook: `Access_Moderation.ipynb`
7. **Attacks Moderation**Highlights how agents can proactively scan for and mitigate adversarial attacks.Notebook: `Attacks_Moderation.ipynb`
8. **Topic Moderation**Explains how different agents work together to filter inappropriate or harmful content topics.Notebook: `Topic_Moderation.ipynb`
9. **Model Moderation**Focuses on how agents can collaborate to protect the model through obfuscation, watermarking, and secure versioning.Notebook: `Model_Moderation.ipynb`
10. **RAG Moderation**
    Explores how agents ensure content integrity and safe data handling in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
    Notebook: `RAG_Moderation.ipynb`

## Key Security Concepts

* **Prompt Injection Prevention**: Safeguarding against manipulated inputs to exploit system vulnerabilities.
* **Output Filtering**: Ensuring generated outputs are safe and accurate.
* **Adversarial Training**: Enhancing model resilience to adversarial inputs.
* **Traffic Filtering**: Preventing malicious access to the system.
* **Ethics & Regulations**: Ensuring LLM usage aligns with societal values and legal standards.

## Conclusion

The notebooks illustrate how a workflow can be designed to moderate and secure different components of an LLM system. They serve as starting points and reminders for structuring moderation strategies, although real-world implementations requires further customization.
