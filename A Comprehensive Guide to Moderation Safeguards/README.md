# A Comprehensive Guide to Moderation Safeguards

This folder contains a series of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various strategies and practices to safeguard and moderate Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of cybersecurity. These notebooks offer examples to protect LLM systems from vulnerabilities and malicious exploitation, **not real implimentations**.

## Overview

LLMs are powerful tools but come with inherent risks. This collection of notebooks focuses on moderating LLM input, output, data, resources, traffic, access, and topics. It also covers specific techniques like prompt injection prevention, adversarial training, and ensuring ethical and regulatory compliance.

### Included Notebooks:

1. **Input Moderation**
   Covers input validation strategies to prevent prompt injections and malicious activity.
   Notebook: `Input-Moderation.ipynb`
2. **Output Moderation**
   Focuses on preventing hallucinations and harmful content generation by LLMs.
   Notebook: `Output_Moderation.ipynb`
3. **Data Moderation**
   Addresses data quality checks, sanitization, and compliance with privacy regulations.
   Notebook: `Data_Moderation.ipynb`
4. **Resource Moderation**
   Ensures system stability by managing computational resources efficiently.
   Notebook: `Resource_Moderation.ipynb`
5. **Traffic Moderation**
   Prevents DoS attacks and maintains balanced system load through rate limiting and filtering.
   Notebook: `Traffic_Moderation.ipynb`
6. **Access Moderation**
   Implements role-based access control and the least privilege principle.
   Notebook: `Access_Moderation.ipynb`
7. **Attacks Moderation**
   Prevents and mitigates adversarial attacks and vulnerabilities through proactive scanning and training.
   Notebook: `Attacks_Moderation.ipynb`
8. **Topic Moderation**
   Filters inappropriate or harmful content topics to ensure ethical model outputs.
   Notebook: `Topic_Moderation.ipynb`
9. **Model Moderation**
   Focuses on protecting the model through obfuscation, watermarking, and secure versioning.
   Notebook: `Model_Moderation.ipynb`
10. **RAG Moderation**
    Secures Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by ensuring content integrity and safe data handling.
    Notebook: `RAG_Moderation.ipynb`

## Key Security Concepts

* **Prompt Injection Prevention** : Safeguarding against manipulated inputs to exploit system vulnerabilities.
* **Output Filtering** : Ensuring generated outputs are safe and accurate.
* **Adversarial Training** : Enhancing model resilience to adversarial inputs.
* **Traffic Filtering** : Preventing malicious access to the system.
* **Ethics & Regulations** : Ensuring LLM usage aligns with societal values and legal standards.

## Conclusion

By following the practices and techniques demonstrated in these notebooks, developers can secure their LLM systems against evolving cybersecurity threats.
