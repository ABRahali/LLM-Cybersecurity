    "# Introduction\n",

    "This script introduces a comprehensive approach to enhance the security and robustness of systems against malicious exploits such as prompt injection attacks, adversarial examples, and system vulnerabilities. It includes the following key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt Injection Prevention**: Implements input validation to ensure that user inputs adhere to predefined character patterns, reducing the risk of harmful instructions being processed.\n",
    "2. **Adversarial Training**: Strengthens machine learning models by exposing them to adversarial samples, improving their resilience to malicious manipulations.\n",
    "3. **Indirect Prompt Injection Mitigation**: Detects and flags potentially harmful contextual instructions by scanning for suspicious keywords.\n",
    "4. **Vulnerability Scanning and Patch Management**: Simulates system scans for vulnerabilities and provides mechanisms to patch identified weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these mechanisms, the code aims to build a secure, proactive framework for defending against various cybersecurity threats.\n"
